PythonDice

First ever full Python project I did from scratch. Thought I might as well figure out how to use Git at the same time, right?
It is basically able to take any amount of dice and any probability in the standard tabletop/pen'n'paper format of xdy

where x = number of dice, and y = total number of possibilities.

ie. 2d6 -> 2 6sided dice.
